Stage 2 — Survive the Night

What you add
How the DAG should look
Definition of done
Stage 1 answers correctly — when somebody types three commands. Nobody at Meridian will. The vendor publishes each month a few days into the next one, unannounced, and operations wants the history since 2021 loaded and every new month in the warehouse without anyone watching.

This stage adds the operational layer, on Airflow 3: it schedules, waits, runs, retries, keeps the books on what was loaded, and tells you how far the warehouse has got.

Important
Stage 1’s jobs stay exactly as they are — not one line changes. just run, just inspect and just report keep working, by hand, with Airflow switched off. Everything in this stage lives around the jobs and calls them.

What you add

1. A DAG per market. One run processes one month of one market.

2. An earliest window per market — where its history starts. Committed configuration; the format is yours, the values are ours: jc 2021-01, nyc 2026-01.

3. A control table, in your warehouse, written by the operational layer, never by a job: after a job succeeds, the task records which job loaded which window, and when. Record only after the job has succeeded — never before — and make recording the same load twice harmless. Hand runs are not recorded.

4. A progress function — computed from the control table whenever it is asked, never stored:

a month is complete when its silver load is recorded, and a gold load is recorded for every day of the month after that silver load;
the watermark is the last month of the unbroken run of complete months starting at the earliest window (null if the earliest window is not complete);
a gap is an incomplete month between the earliest window and the newest complete month;
the next month due is the earliest incomplete month from the earliest window on.
5. The recipes.

just up                                       # also starts Airflow, with every schedule OFF
just schedule     <market> <on|off>
just run pipeline <market>                    # the next month due
just run pipeline <market> <month>            # that month, even if already complete
just run pipeline <market> <month> <month>    # every month in the range, as an Airflow backfill
just inspect coverage <job>
just inspect runs     <market>

run pipeline blocks until its runs finish, and exits non-zero if any failed.

just inspect coverage trips:jc
 -> {"job":"trips:jc","earliest":"2021-01","watermark":"2021-02","complete":3,"gaps":["2021-03"],"next":"2021-03"}

just inspect runs jc          # newest run first; types and states are Airflow's own words
 -> {"market":"jc","runs":[{"month":"2026-06","type":"manual","state":"success","tasks":{
      "ingest-to-bronze trips:jc 2026-06":    {"state":"success","tries":1},
      "transform-to-silver trips:jc 2026-06": {"state":"success","tries":2},
      "transform-to-gold station-daily":      {"state":"success","tries":1,"days":30,"failed_days":[]}}}]}

How the DAG should look

which month?
is it due?
wait until
published
ingest-to-bronze
transform-to-silver
gold batch:
station-daily × every day
Task	Runs how	Why
ingest-to-bronze	in-process — import your package, call the job	I/O
transform-to-silver	subprocess: just run transform-to-silver <job> <month>	CPU — keep it off Airflow’s workers
gold batch	in-process, one task per month — call stage 1’s day job for each day, recording each day as it succeeds	I/O, and a day is too small to be a task
Hints:

Task bodies call code. The day loop, the recording and the progress function live in your package; the DAG file only wires calls together.
The subprocess needs glue: just and Docker Compose inside Airflow, access to the Docker daemon, and the same compose project as just up, so it sees the same bronze volume and warehouse.
Each scheduled run must be about exactly one calendar month. A bare cron string on Airflow 3 gives an empty data interval — use an interval timetable, or derive the month yourself.
Wait without holding a worker (a reschedule-mode sensor), with a timeout that fails the run.
Months are independent — let several run at once. Airflow’s default concurrency is far below what a laptop can do.
Definition of done

Stage 1 is untouched

With Airflow stopped, stage 1’s commands still give stage 1’s answers — and run pipeline jc 2026-06 gives byte-identical answers (216 departures, 209 arrivals at JC115 on 2026-06-02).
Stage 1’s checks still pass.
Running

A run has three job tasks; the gold batch reports days: 30 for 2026-06 and 28 for 2021-02.
run pipeline jc 2021-01 2021-02 succeeds across the schema change; both runs are type: backfill.
On a fresh stack, schedule jc on fills 68 complete months, no gaps, watermark 2026-08 within 30 minutes, as type: scheduled runs.
A scheduled run for a month already complete does nothing: success, work skipped.
Progress

Loading 2021-01 entirely by hand leaves coverage at nothing complete; run pipeline jc then takes 2021-01.
After 2021-01, 2021-02 and 2021-04 are complete: watermark 2021-02, gaps ["2021-03"]. Windowless runs take 2021-03, then 2021-05.
Re-running a complete month by name changes no answer and no coverage.
With nothing due (the next month is unpublished), run pipeline jc exits 0: month: null, work skipped.
A named re-run killed after silver and before gold finishes makes that month incomplete again, and it becomes next.
Failure

A month before the earliest window (run pipeline jc 2019-06) fails at once: failed, tries: 1, downstream upstream_failed, nothing written. A month after the newest published one waits.
A silver container killed mid-work is retried: the run succeeds with tries ≥ 2.
When a gold day fails, the batch finishes the other days, records them, then fails naming the failed days; the retry redoes only those. While gold rebuilds, report always returns a complete answer for every day.
The same month fired twice at once gives exactly what one run gives.
